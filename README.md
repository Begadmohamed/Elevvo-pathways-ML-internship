# 🌟 Elevvo Pathways – Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains the 4 machine learning tasks I completed as part of the **Elevvo Pathways Internship Program**. Each task explores real-world data challenges and applies key ML concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, and time series forecasting.

Successful completion of these tasks leads to official certification from Elevvo. 🏅
